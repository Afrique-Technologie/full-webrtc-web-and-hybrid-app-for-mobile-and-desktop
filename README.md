# full-webrtc-web-and-hybrid-app-for-mobile-and-desktop
WebRTC web and hybrid app for mobile and desktop. The mobile hybrid app was developed with the React Native framework, and the Desktop hybrid app was developed with the Electron cross-platform framework for Windows and Raspbian OS.    

The source codes of diffrent apps have been stored on Google Drive, you can download all of them through the following links.

All of these four WebRTC clients are independents. You can use each of them separately with the server. For exemple, if you just need the code for the React Native hybrid mobile app, you can download the node server code and the "WebRTC-React-Native-Heabrid-App" code google drive.

Here we give you the code for four separate client applications that were needed for our thesis, but you can use them as you want.
