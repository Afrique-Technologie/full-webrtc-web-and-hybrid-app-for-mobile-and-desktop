# full-webrtc-web-and-hybrid-app-for-mobile-and-desktop

This video conferencing solution based on WebRTC technology was implemented to conduct a comparative study between WebRTC solutions based on web browsers and those based on a hybrid application, on mobile and Raspberry Pi, as part of our PhD thesis "Implementation of a Video Conferencing Platform based on WebRTC Technology".    

The source codes of diffrent apps have been stored on Google Drive, you can download all of them through the following links.

All of these four WebRTC clients are independents. You can use each of them separately with the server. For exemple, if you just need the code for the React Native hybrid mobile app, you can download the "Server.zip" file and the "WebRTC-React-Native-Heabrid-App.zip" file from google drive.

Here we give you the code for the different client applications that were needed for our thesis, but you can use them according to your needs.
